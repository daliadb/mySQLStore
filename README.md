# mySQLStore

## Welcome to BAMAZON!

Here, we've created an Amazon-like storefront with the help of MySQL & Node.js. Our app will take orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

## Interact with the Store

1. Tell Bamazon the product ID for what you would like to buy.

2. Tell Bamazon how many units you would like to buy.

3. If Bamazon doesn't have it, your order won't go through and you'll get an error message.

4. If Bamazon does have it, your customer order will be fulfilled.
